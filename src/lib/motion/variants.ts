 *   remains as feedback. Stable unique `key`s (the record id, never the index).

 *
 * Unlike `glidePattern` (a gesture-prop bundle with no transition of its

 * uses `enterTransition`/`exitTransition` like the rest of this file. Each
 * key is a function of Motion's `custom` prop (not a `direction` argument
 * called ahead of time) — this matters for `AnimatePresence`: an exiting
 * element's `custom` is snapshotted at the moment it's removed, so its

 * renders has already changed by the time the exit plays out. Usage:
