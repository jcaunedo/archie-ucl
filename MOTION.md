# Motion System

How motion is designed and built in this library: principles, the named patterns, component guidance, accessibility and validation.

**This file holds the rules, not the values.** Adjust motion values (tokens, durations, easings, springs, distances, variants and patterns) in the code, in `src/lib/motion/`. Storybook shows the current values under Foundations → Motion. Rules for one specific component's motion live in [DESIGN.md](DESIGN.md).

Use Motion for React from `motion/react`. All motion values come from `src/lib/motion/`. Use those exports; don't write raw durations, easings or distances in components.

Motion explains a change in state, preserves spatial continuity and keeps the interface responsive. Don't animate for decoration. If an animation doesn't improve clarity, feedback, orientation or perceived speed, leave it out. When unsure, choose the more subtle option.

## Personality

Calm, refined, natural, responsive. Never bouncy, cartoonish, mechanical or distracting.

- **Prefer:** fade, soft scale, gentle elevation, short directional slide, crossfade, shared-element transition, smooth layout transition, subtle stagger.
- **Use sparingly:** rotation under 2°, parallax, scroll-linked movement, expressive springs.
- **Avoid unless asked:** bounce, shake, spin, elastic overshoot, full-screen wipes, dramatic zoom, long travel.

## Tokens (`src/lib/motion/tokens.ts`)

| Token                         | Value  | Use                                    |
| ----------------------------- | ------ | -------------------------------------- |
| `motionDuration.instant`      | 120 ms | Instant feedback                       |
| `motionDuration.fast`         | 160 ms | Hover/press feedback, exits            |
| `motionDuration.normal`       | 300 ms | Standard UI transitions                |
| `motionDuration.slow`         | 500 ms | Panels, overlays, entrances            |
| `motionDuration.deliberate`   | 600 ms | Page-level transitions, auto-scroll    |
| `motionDistance.hover`        | 3 px   | Lift                                   |
| `motionDistance.subtle`       | 8 px   | Reveal                                 |
| `motionDistance.small`        | 12 px  | Component transitions                  |
| `motionDistance.medium`       | 24 px  | Panels, Glide                          |
| `motionDistance.large`        | 40 px  | Page transitions                       |
| `motionScale.press`           | 0.98   | Press                                  |
| `motionScale.mediaHover`      | 1.03   | Media inside a Lift card               |

Don't go past `deliberate` (600 ms). A new value goes in `tokens.ts` with a comment saying what it's for, never inline in a component.

## Transitions (`transitions.ts`)

- `standardTransition`: common UI changes. Smooth acceleration, controlled deceleration, no overshoot.
- `enterTransition`: elements arriving. Quick start, gentle finish.
- `exitTransition`: elements leaving. Shorter than enter, decisive.
- `subtleSpring` / `responsiveSpring` / `layoutSpring`: press, direct manipulation, layout and shared-element movement. High damping, no visible bounce.

## Vocabulary

Use these named patterns before inventing new motion. Gesture patterns live in `patterns.ts`, presence patterns in `variants.ts`.

| Pattern  | Use for                                | Implementation                                  |
| -------- | -------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| Lift     | Hoverable cards and surfaces           | `liftPattern`, `liftWithMediaPattern`           |
| Press    | Buttons, cards, direct interactions    | `pressPattern`                                  |
| Reveal   | Content appearing in context           | `revealVariants`                                |
| Expand   | A region opening/closing in place      | `expandVariants` + `useExpandClip()`            |
| Connect  | Shared-element transitions             | `layoutId` + `layoutSpring`                     |
| Flow     | Small groups entering together         | `staggerContainerVariants` + children `revealVariants` |
| Glide    | Directional navigation                 | `slideVariants` (`custom={1 \| -1}`), `glidePattern` |
| Dismiss  | Content removed or closed              | `dismissVariants`; table/list rows: `rowRemoveVariants` |
| Confirm  | Lightweight success feedback           | `confirmPattern`                                |
| Pending  | Work in progress on an element's behalf | `pendingIconVariants`, `pendingSurfaceVariants`; a status label: `pendingTextVariants` (a slow highlight sweep, `motionDuration.pendingShimmer`) |

Plus `fadeVariants`, `overlayVariants` (scrims), `panelVariants` (drawers) and `iconSwapVariants` (one small element replacing another in place).

## Component guidance

- **Buttons:** press scale 0.98, fast release, never delay the action for the animation, never animate dimensions.
- **Cards:** Lift on hover, media scale up to 1.03, no motion on non-interactive cards.
- **Inputs:** motion clarifies focus, validation and conditional fields. Keep layout stable. No shake.
- **Menus/dropdowns:** short fade plus a small movement from the trigger.
- **Dialogs/overlays:** `AnimatePresence`, overlay fade, small surface movement, exit shorter than entrance. Usable immediately.
- **Tabs:** active indicator via shared `layoutId`.
- **Lists:** `AnimatePresence` with stable unique keys (never the index). Don't replay entrances on routine data updates.
- **Loading:** subtle opacity pulse. No aggressive or high-contrast loaders.

## Layout and presence

- Use `layout` for size/position changes and `layoutId` for shared elements. Don't hand-compute positions Motion can manage.
- Use `AnimatePresence` only for mount/unmount. Its direct children need stable unique keys.
- Animate `opacity` and `transform` by preference. Avoid continuously animating `top`/`left`/`margin`/`padding`/`box-shadow`.
- Never animate the same property with CSS and Motion at once.
- A panel that collapses beside other content (ChatPanel) animates its width with a CSS transition, timed from `src/lib/motion`, so its neighbors follow it. Fade its content out before it narrows and in after it widens, so nothing visibly reflows. DESIGN.md "Chat panel" has the details.

## Accessibility

Always respect reduced motion: use `useMotionPreference()` and its `resolve()` helper. Under reduced motion:
- Remove nonessential transforms, parallax and large movement.
- Prefer opacity.
- Keep state-change feedback: it becomes near-instant (`reducedMotionTransition`), it doesn't disappear.

Motion is never the only signal of a state change. Keyboard behavior, focus order and visible focus must survive every animation.

## Validation

After motion work, check that:
- The build passes.
- There's no flash or layout shift.
- Exits complete.
- Rapid repeated interaction doesn't break state.
- Reduced motion works.
- Nothing blocks clicks, scrolling or navigation.
